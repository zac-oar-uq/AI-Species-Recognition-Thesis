# Logs

This directory contains all logs created during the training and validation of all models throughout the project.  These logs can be viewed using TensorFlow's Tensorboard feature.

## extractors/

Contains logs for all extractors used throughout the project, for each dataset.  This includes the standard extractors, trained on un-augmented datasets, as well as the blur and gray extractors which are trained on datasets augmented to be blurred and grayed, respectively.

## multi-aug-classifiers/

Contains logs for all classifiers which use augments to artifically create inputs for a multi-image classifier architecture.  This includes logs generated by the ensemble_aug_classifier and the randaug_classifier.  There are also logs generated by the ensemble_aug_classifier which use "normal" images and interior extractors - used as a ground-truth to compare accuracies with the augmented version.

## multi-image-classifiers/

Contains logs for all multi-image classifier implemented throughout the project.  This includes the 3_img_ensemble model, as well as the multi_img_rnn_classifier model.  The RNN classifier has also been tested with a range of image inputs: from 1-5.
